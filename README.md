##How it Works
FashionGPT uses a pre-trained ResNet50 model as a feature extractor to analyze the visual aspects of a user's selected image. It then compares the extracted features with a database of product images to find the most visually similar items. The Nearest Neighbors algorithm is employed to identify the top 5 matching products based on their similarity scores.

##Key Features
State-of-the-art deep learning model for feature extraction
Efficient and accurate product recommendations
